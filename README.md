# Belly Button Biodiversity

Welcome one more time! 

This project has the goal to explore Plotly.js of JavaScript, combined with Flask and Heroku. Plotly.js library allows to build interactive dashboards to explore datasets. 

Having said that, you'll find a PIE chart that displays the top 10 samples of Belly Button Biodiversity bacterias and also a Bubble Chart to display each sample.

Each key/value pair comes from the metadata JSON object. All of the plots are automatically updated any time that a new sample is selected. 

Flask API was used to serve the data needed for the plots.
