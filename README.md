Having said that, you'll find a PIE chart that displays the top 10 samples of Belly Button Biodiversity bacterias and also a Bubble Chart to display each sample.

Each key/value pair comes from the metadata JSON object. All of the plots are automatically updated any time that a new sample is selected.
